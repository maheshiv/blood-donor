This is sample project to demonstrate es6 in emberJS and expressJS.

Here are the steps to setup the project,
>> Clone the project
>> Open two tabs in the Command line
>> In one tab, goto root of the folder, run `npm install` (to install dependent node modules) and then run `npm start`
>> In another tab, goto client folder and run `npm install && bower install`(to install node and bower modules) and then run `npm start`
